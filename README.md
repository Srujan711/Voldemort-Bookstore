Welcome to the Voldemort Bookstore!!

This is github repository for the progress of how the bookstore is shaped and got working. 

The different folders of the repo suggest what part of the online bookstore has been implemented in that folder, you can make it out from the folder title itself. 

If you want to check out the online bookstore application fork this repo and run the backend on a tomcat server first and then run the frontend on a localhost by running this commmand over terminal 'npm run dev'

Please checkout the working online bookstore which stores credit card data and lets you get back to shopping where you left by running the voldemort-bookstore-session-client
